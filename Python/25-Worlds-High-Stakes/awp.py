"""
Here's the situation:
A team participates in several tournaments each year. The number varies by team. 
At each tournament, the team participates in a number of Qualification Matches. That number also varies by tournament. 
They will get 0, 1, or 2 autonomous win points in each match. 
We want to compare the teams based on their points which reflect their skill level.

How do we standardize the measure? The following is what we will use:
average ap per match = P / M
where:
- P is calculated as sum of (wp - 2 * number of Qualification Matches won in a specific tournament)
- M is the total number of matches they've competed in so far

Pseudocode:
for each team:
    total_awp = 0
    total_matches = 0

    for each tournament
        matches_won = 0
        [parse .json ...]
        get the number of Qs the team competed in. + to total_matches
        if team score > opponent score, +1 to matches_won. (there's an easier way from rankings json response)

        get rankings, which will tell us the team's wp.
        awp = wp - 2 * matches_won
        total_awp += awp
    
    if total_matches != 0, avg_awp = total_awp / total_matches
