Since there are several schemas we wish to get information on, I wrote a script that could automate this process and generate corresponding copies when run. 

### How to use the `generate.sh` script
1. In Bash, cd into `3-generic`
2. Type `chmod -x generate.sh`
3. Type `./generate.sh`

This will generate the .json files you see in the [3-generic](../3-generic/) folder.
